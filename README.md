    <b>Conarn</b> is a save file editor for the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881650/Content_Warning/">Content Warning</a> by <b>Landfall</b>.
</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

## Usage
Depending on if you downloaded the source code directly or the executable, you will run **conarn.pyw** or **conarn.exe** respectively. Once ran, it will recognize any current saves where **Content Warning** save files are stored. 
<br />
<br />
*(This is typically at C:/Users/[USERNAME]/AppData/LocalLow/Landfall Games/Content Warning/Saves which is where it will check)*
<br />
<br />
<br />
It will display any found files for you to edit.
