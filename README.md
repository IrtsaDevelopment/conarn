# conarn
Conarn is a save file editor for the game [Content Warning](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881650/Content_Warning/) by **Landfall**.
<br />
<br />
<br />
## Usage
Depending on if you downloaded the source code directly or the executable, you will run **conarn.pyw** or **conarn.exe** respectively. Once ran, it will recognize any current saves where **Content Warning** save files are stored. 
<br />
<br />
*(This is typically at C:/Users/[USERNAME]/AppData/LocalLow/Landfall Games/Content Warning/Saves which is where it will check)*
<br />
<br />
<br />
It will display any found files for you to edit.
